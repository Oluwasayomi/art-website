## 🎨 Art Website 

An animated website exploring art, shedding more light on the various types/categories of art. Following the duty of any art, the design was also made to reflect an artistic mindset, using colour theory, artistic images, and ensuring that it all worked together to create a visually appealing user interface.

## ✍️ The Process

I wanted to build a website that made the complex topics of art engaging and easier to understand through visual images, simple text, and easy interactability. Whether you're new to art or looking for a new way to express your art, the art website helps bring more concepts to your attention— in a way that is easy to navigate! 

I first researched the various categories and types of art, also looking into colour theory to provide an artistic visual as well. I then started simple, bringing the idea to life with the structuring of HTML and styling with CSS. Once the basic website was in place, I included different styling based on the screen size, ensuring the website was adaptable for PC, tablet, and phone views.

Afterwards, I added scrolling and button animations to make the website more interactive. I also made the pop-up login/register form and other necessary adjustments to ensure the website was responsive  

Finally, I started filtering the types of art according to their respective types, putting them in their various categories.
